Last week featured a number of small bug fixes in Montage for the [button](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1275), [blueprints](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1276), [flow](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1235) and an [update to Mr v0.13.3](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1239). The translate composer [now supports the standard `wheel` event](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1273). There was also a [large update to Montage's MediaController](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1213) which paved the way for a brand new [video player in Digit](https://github.com/montagejs/digit/pull/19/files)!

You can see Montage in action on the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) website, and last week Mike Czepiel [updated the example to Montage v0.13](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/666).

And finally, there has been some interesting work to define compilers and translators for Mr in the `package.json`. It's not ready for use yet, but you can get a [sneak preview in this pull request](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/pull/43).
