As one of the most commonly used components it's important that the [Repetition](http://montagejs.org/docs/repetition.html) is fast, and to this end [some unnesesary bindings have been removed](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1308). Montage has also been [updated to use last week's releases](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1306) of FRB and Collections.

The List's scrolling behaviour was fixed in both [Matte](https://github.com/montagejs/matte/pull/25) and [Digit](https://github.com/montagejs/digit/pull/36), and a [vertical slider](https://github.com/montagejs/digit/pull/39) was also added Digit.

Our [API documentation](http://montagejs.org/api/) has been updated to contain [links to the source of symbol definitions](https://github.com/montagejs/montagejs.org/pull/45), and the new features in FRB [are now documented](https://github.com/montagejs/frb/pull/21).

The montage-testing package recieved an [update to Jasmine](https://github.com/montagejs/montage-testing/pull/7) so that tests can be run on Saucelabs.
