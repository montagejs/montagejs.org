# Overview: Themes

The Montage framework includes three widget sets or themes for user interface components: Digit, Matte, and Native.

* Digit is a touch-friendly theme optimized for use with tablets and mobile devices. 
* Matte contains desktop-optimized UI components. 
* Native uses the browser's default styles. 

Digit is part of the default MontageJS distribution. If you want to use the Matte and Native themes you have to install them separately.
